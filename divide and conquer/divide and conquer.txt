this file records the leetcode about divide and conquer.
when it comes to divide and conquer, we should kown that it has three characteristics, as follow:
1.the subquestion has the same character as the orignal question;
2.we should slove the subquestion independently as possible as we can;
3.when we divide the subquestion, we should divide them as equally as we can.
the fake code of divide and conquer can be summerized as follow:
divide-and-conquer(P):
1.if |p|<=c the S(p)
2.devide P into p1,p2,p3,...,pk
3.for i<-1 to k
4.  yi=divide-and-conquer(pi)
5.return merge(p1,p2,p3,...,pk)
